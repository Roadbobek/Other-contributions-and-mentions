- github.com/ShivamKR12/Level_Editor

My code is in the Ursina engine Level_Editor repository by ShivamKR12. I originally forked it and added a temporary fix for a gizmo scaling issue. He then made me a Contributor on the original repository, and I added my code. It was originally supposed to be more of a simple temporary fix that patches the symptoms of an underlying cause but seeing as from the time im writing this, it has been nearly 5 months so I guess it has held up fine. The original Level_Editor repository remains unfinished with a lot of junk files in it, so I recommend using my fork, https://github.com/Roadbobek/Improved_Level_Editor_Ursina_Engine/tree/master.
